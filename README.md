# 👋🏽 Hey there, I’m Selina Loggins!

I'm a future-ready Cloud Engineer passionate about DevOps, Infrastructure-as-Code, and building secure, scalable systems. After an accomplished career in IT project management and compliance, I’ve pivoted into the world of cloud and cybersecurity — and I’m loving every minute of it.

## 💻 Latest Project: MediaCatalog on AWS

🔗 [media-catalog-dynamodb](https://github.com/tatiLogg/media-catalog-dynamodb)  
A secure, read-only DynamoDB infrastructure deployed with CloudFormation.

This hands-on project simulates a media company needing centralized metadata storage.  
I designed the architecture using **AWS best practices**, focusing on:

- ✅ IAM least privilege (read-only role)
- ✅ EC2 + SSH key management
- ✅ Subnet + Security Group access control
- ✅ Fully automated deployment via YAML CloudFormation
- ✅ Write protection validation (put-item blocked by design)

It’s fully tested and ready to demo in interviews. 🙌
